  
It's really impossible for me to pay for this course. I want to take this course as I want to
complete this Python course on Coursera. I need financial aid because I am from
India and my income cannot pay for this course. Now I do not have a job to pay for it. My
father income cannot neither pay for it. I'm a fresh graduate from faculty of science, I didn't
start my career yet and I need the financial aid because I can't afford the courses without
having a job .I need to take this course to work and have money to increase my skill and
help my father. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in
previous Signature Track Courses. Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I
have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken
on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will
an invaluable learning opportunity.I hope these reasons are enough I really thank you. So I
need your help by giving me financial aid.
The course will help me study data mining that help me work a freelance to earn money. I'll
always participate in the discussion forms and help others with my knowledge. I will meet
deadlines and will not hesitate to ask if there's something I don't understand The certificate
would be a valuable thin for me because it'll help me get better job opportunities and start
my career as fast as possible. It'll show that I'm a hard worker and self learner also that I'm
very active. I want to add to my CV in the future. Then i want to complete the data mining
Specialization on Coursera. I think it will be beneficial for my thesis work. A verified
certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course.I will share my
information to help other to learn and work to earn money. I hope that you give me the
chance. And finally I really thank you
