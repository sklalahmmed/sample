I’m a student from India and want to learn java . I think it will be beneficial for my
thesis work. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expanses to pay for the certificate of this
course. I live only depend on my parents. In this
circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the
certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my
monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. I want to take this course
as I want to learn Python . I want to complete the this course. This Course will boost my job prospects
after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in carrying out for interview and
give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the
certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as
I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also I intend to participate in Discussion
Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online
courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer
reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.
